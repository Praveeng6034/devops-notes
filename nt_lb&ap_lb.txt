Application Load Balancer (ALB)
This is the distribution of requests based on multiple variables, from the network layer to the application layer. It is context-aware and can direct requests based on any single variable as easily as it can a combination of variables. Applications are load balanced based on their peculiar behavior and not solely on server (operating system or virtualization layer) information.

This is feature fulled Layer-7 load balancer, HTTP and HTTPS listeners only. Provides the ability to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic based upon rules, host based or path based. Like an NLB, each Target can be on different ports. Even supports HTTP/2. Configurable range of health check status codes (CLB only supports 200 OK for HTTP health checks).

With ALB, it is a requirement that you enable at least two or more Availability Zones.

Network Load Balancer (NLB)
This is the distribution of traffic based on network variables, such as IP address and destination ports. It is layer 4 (TCP) and below and is not designed to take into consideration anything at the application layer such as content type, cookie data, custom headers, user location, or the application behavior. It is context-less, caring only about the network-layer information contained within the packets it is directing this way and that.

This is a TCP Load Balancer only that does some NAT magic at the VPC level. It uses EIPs, so it has a static endpoint unlike ALB and CLBs (by default). Each Target can be on different ports.

With NLB, Elastic Load Balancing creates a network interface for each Availability Zone that you enable.
